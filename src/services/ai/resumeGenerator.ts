      Create an optimized resume using the following information and sticking to the instructions provided:

      Original Resume:
      ${originalResume}

      Job Description:
      ${jobDescription}

      Company Values:
      ${Object.entries(companyInfo.values).map(([key, value]) => `${key}: ${value}`).join(', ')}

      Company Culture:
      ${companyInfo.culture}
      Instructions:
      1. Optimize this resume specifically for the provided job description, ensuring alignment with the company's stated values and culture. 
        - Highlight the most relevant achievements, skills, and experiences that directly match the job description.
        - Use industry-specific keywords and terminology from the job description to improve ATS compatibility.
        - Incorporate references to the company's values and culture, using language that demonstrates alignment (e.g., teamwork, innovation, adaptability).

      2. Structure the resume for ATS readability:
        - Use clean, standard formatting (e.g., bullet points, clear headers, no graphics or columns).
        - Prioritize clear section headings: "Professional Summary," "Skills," "Experience," "Education," and "Certifications" (if applicable).
        - Ensure correct use of keywords and phrases from the job description in each section without overstuffing.

      3. Enhance readability and relevance:
        - Write a compelling "Professional Summary" at the top of the resume, emphasizing your most impactful and relevant qualifications.
        - Focus on quantifiable results and achievements in the "Experience" section (e.g., "Increased revenue by 25% by developing new marketing strategies").
        - Tailor the "Skills" section to align with the role, grouping technical and soft skills effectively.

      4. Maintain concise yet impactful language:
        - Avoid generic phrases like "responsible for" and replace them with action verbs like "achieved," "led," or "implemented."
        - Ensure each bullet point is specific and measurable where possible (e.g., "Managed a team of 10 to deliver a 15% improvement in efficiency").

      6. Ensure ATS compatibility:
        - Provide the final resume in both plain-text and formatted versions (if applicable) for system compatibility.
        - Prioritize standard file formats (e.g., Word or PDF based on job requirements).

      Generate the optimized resume and provide an overview of the changes made to align with the job description, company values, and ATS best practices.
      Reply back with only the resume content. No preface or additional information needed.
